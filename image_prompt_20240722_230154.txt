Create an image that combines elements of economics and superheroes. The image should feature a cityscape split down the middle, with one side representing Gotham (dark and gritty) and the other side representing Metropolis (bright and futuristic). Overlay economic symbols like graphs, dollar signs, and stock tickers on the cityscape. In the sky, show the silhouettes of Batman and Superman facing each other, with a line graph between them showing diverging economic trends.
