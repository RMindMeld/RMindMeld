## Introduction

In the realm of literature, the question of authorship has long fascinated scholars and readers alike. From the debate surrounding Shakespeare's plays to modern ghostwriting controversies, determining who truly penned a piece of writing can be both intriguing and challenging. But what if we could use the power of programming and data science to unmask the author behind the words?

Enter the world of stylometry - the statistical analysis of literary style. This fascinating field sits at the intersection of literature, linguistics, and computer science, offering a unique approach to analyzing texts. In this blog post, we'll explore how Python can be used to detect an author's "linguistic fingerprint," potentially revealing the true identity behind anonymous or disputed works.

## The Science of Stylometry

Stylometry is based on the premise that every author has a unique writing style - a linguistic fingerprint that persists across their works. This fingerprint is composed of various elements:

1. Vocabulary richness and diversity
2. Sentence structure and length
3. Use of function words (e.g., "the", "and", "of")
4. Punctuation patterns
5. Preferred phrases or idioms

By analyzing these elements statistically, we can create a profile of an author's style. This profile can then be compared to other texts to determine likely authorship.

## Building Our Stylometric Toolkit

Let's dive into some Python code to see how we can start building our own stylometric analysis tools. We'll use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which provides a wealth of resources for natural language processing.

First, let's create a function to analyze the basic stylometric features of a text:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from collections import Counter

def analyze_text(text):
    # Tokenize the text into words and sentences
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    
    # Calculate basic metrics
    word_count = len(words)
    sentence_count = len(sentences)
    avg_sentence_length = word_count / sentence_count
    
    # Calculate vocabulary richness (Type-Token Ratio)
    unique_words = set(words)
    ttr = len(unique_words) / word_count
    
    # Get most common words
    word_freq = Counter(words)
    most_common = word_freq.most_common(10)
    
    return {
        'word_count': word_count,
        'sentence_count': sentence_count,
        'avg_sentence_length': avg_sentence_length,
        'vocab_richness': ttr,
        'most_common_words': most_common
    }

# Example usage:
sample_text = """
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair.
"""

results = analyze_text(sample_text)
print(results)
```

This function provides a basic analysis of a text, including word count, sentence count, average sentence length, vocabulary richness (measured by the Type-Token Ratio), and the most common words used.

## Comparing Authors

Now that we have a basic analysis function, let's expand our toolkit to compare multiple texts and visualize the results. We'll use matplotlib to create a simple visualization of vocabulary richness across different texts.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Dummy data for illustration
authors = ['Austen', 'Dickens', 'Wilde', 'Unknown']
vocab_richness = [0.15, 0.12, 0.18, 0.16]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
bars = plt.bar(authors, vocab_richness, color=['blue', 'green', 'red', 'gray'])
plt.title('Vocabulary Richness Comparison')
plt.xlabel('Authors')
plt.ylabel('Type-Token Ratio')

# Add value labels on top of each bar
for bar in bars:
    height = bar.get_height()
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., height,
             f'{height:.2f}',
             ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.show()
```

This visualization allows us to quickly compare the vocabulary richness of different authors, including our "Unknown" text. In this example, we can see that the Unknown author's vocabulary richness is closest to that of Oscar Wilde, providing a clue to potential authorship.

## Advanced Techniques: Stylometric Fingerprinting

While basic metrics like vocabulary richness are useful, more advanced techniques can provide even more accurate authorship attribution. One such technique is the use of function words - common words like "the", "and", "of" that are used regardless of the topic of the text.

Let's create a function to analyze the usage of function words in a text:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

def function_word_profile(text):
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    function_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    
    word_freq = Counter(words)
    function_word_freq = {word: count for word, count in word_freq.items() if word in function_words}
    
    total_words = sum(word_freq.values())
    function_word_ratios = {word: count/total_words for word, count in function_word_freq.items()}
    
    return function_word_ratios

# Example usage:
profile = function_word_profile(sample_text)
print(profile)
```

This function creates a profile of function word usage in a text, which can serve as a more robust "fingerprint" of an author's style.

## Putting It All Together: A Case Study

Let's imagine we have a mysterious manuscript, and we suspect it might have been written by one of three authors: Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, or Oscar Wilde. We can use our stylometric tools to investigate.

First, we'd need to gather sample texts from each author and our unknown text. Then, we'd apply our analysis functions to each text:

```python
authors = {
    'Austen': austen_text,
    'Dickens': dickens_text,
    'Wilde': wilde_text,
    'Unknown': unknown_text
}

results = {}
for author, text in authors.items():
    results[author] = {
        'basic_analysis': analyze_text(text),
        'function_word_profile': function_word_profile(text)
    }
```

Next, we'd compare the results, looking for similarities between our unknown text and the known authors. We might find that the unknown text has a vocabulary richness very similar to Wilde's, uses sentence structures more like Austen's, but has a function word profile closer to Dickens'.

To visualize these complex relationships, we could use dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to plot our texts in a two-dimensional space:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Extract feature vectors (this is a simplified example)
feature_vectors = [
    [
        results[author]['basic_analysis']['vocab_richness'],
        results[author]['basic_analysis']['avg_sentence_length'],
        # ... other features ...
    ]
    for author in authors
]

# Normalize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
normalized_vectors = scaler.fit_transform(feature_vectors)

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca_result = pca.fit_transform(normalized_vectors)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
for i, author in enumerate(authors):
    plt.scatter(pca_result[i, 0], pca_result[i, 1], label=author)
    plt.annotate(author, (pca_result[i, 0], pca_result[i, 1]))

plt.title('Author Style Comparison')
plt.xlabel('First Principal Component')
plt.ylabel('Second Principal Component')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This visualization would show us how similar or different our unknown text is to the known authors in terms of overall style.

## Conclusion

Stylometry offers a fascinating bridge between the worlds of literature and data science. By applying programming techniques to literary analysis, we can uncover patterns and insights that might elude traditional close reading methods. 

However, it's important to note that while these techniques can provide strong evidence, they're not infallible. Factors like an author's style evolving over time, deliberate attempts to imitate another's style, or collaborative works can all complicate authorship attribution.

As we continue to refine these techniques and develop new ones, the field of stylometry promises to shed new light on age-old questions of authorship and perhaps even reveal new insights into the nature of literary style itself.

The next time you pick up a book, remember - hidden in the words on the page is a unique linguistic fingerprint, waiting to be decoded by the keen eye of a literary detective armed with the tools of data science.
