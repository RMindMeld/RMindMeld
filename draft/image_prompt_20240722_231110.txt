Create an image of a fractal pattern that visually represents the concept of recursion. The fractal should be intricate and colorful, with repeating patterns that become smaller as they branch out. Use vibrant blues, greens, and purples to create a mesmerizing and psychedelic effect. The overall shape should resemble a tree or a branching structure, symbolizing the recursive nature of function calls in programming.
