From the debate surrounding Shakespeare's plays to modern ghostwriting controversies, determining who truly penned a piece of writing can be both intriguing and challenging. But what if we could use the power of programming and data science to unmask the author behind the words?\n\nEnter the world of stylometry - the statistical analysis of literary style. This fascinating field sits at the intersection of literature, linguistics, and computer science, offering a unique approach to analyzing texts. In this blog post, we'll explore how Python can be used to detect an author's \"linguistic fingerprint,\" potentially revealing the true identity behind anonymous or disputed works.\n\n## The Science of Stylometry\n\nStylometry is based on the premise that every author has a unique writing style - a linguistic fingerprint that persists across their works. This fingerprint is composed of various elements:\n\n1. Vocabulary richness and diversity\n2. Sentence structure and length\n3. Use of function words (e.g., \"the\", \"and\", \"of\")\n4. Punctuation patterns\n5. Preferred phrases or idioms\n\nBy analyzing these elements statistically, we can create a profile of an author's style. This profile can then be compared to other texts to determine likely authorship.\n\n## Building Our Stylometric Toolkit\n\nLet's dive into some Python code to see how we can start building our own stylometric analysis tools. We'll use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which provides a wealth of resources for natural language processing.\n\nFirst, let's create a function to analyze the basic stylometric features of a text:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef analyze_text(text):\n    # Tokenize the text into words and sentences\n    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())\n    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n    \n    # Calculate basic metrics\n    word_count = len(words)\n    sentence_count = len(sentences)\n    avg_sentence_length = word_count / sentence_count\n    \n    # Calculate vocabulary richness (Type-Token Ratio)\n    unique_words = set(words)\n    ttr = len(unique_words) / word_count\n    \n    # Get most common words\n    word_freq = Counter(words)\n    most_common = word_freq.most_common(10)\n    \n    return {\n        'word_count': word_count,\n        'sentence_count': sentence_count,\n        'avg_sentence_length': avg_sentence_length,\n        'vocab_richness': ttr,\n        'most_common_words': most_common\n    }\n\n# Example usage:\nsample_text = \"\"\"\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,\nit was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,\nit was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,\nit was the winter of despair.\n\"\"\"\n\nresults = analyze_text(sample_text)\nprint(results)\n```\n\nThis function provides a basic analysis of a text, including word count, sentence count, average sentence length, vocabulary richness (measured by the Type-Token Ratio), and the most common words used.\n\n## Comparing Authors\n\nNow that we have a basic analysis function, let's expand our toolkit to compare multiple texts and visualize the results. We'll use matplotlib to create a simple visualization of vocabulary richness across different texts.\n\n::: {#f918722a .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Dummy data for illustration\nauthors = ['Austen', 'Dickens', 'Wilde', 'Unknown']\nvocab_richness = [0.15, 0.12, 0.18, 0.16]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nbars = plt.bar(authors, vocab_richness, color=['blue', 'green', 'red', 'gray'])\nplt.title('Vocabulary Richness Comparison')\nplt.xlabel('Authors')\nplt.ylabel('Type-Token Ratio')\n\n# Add value labels on top of each bar\nfor bar in bars:\n    height = bar.get_height()\n    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., height,\n             f'{height:.2f}',\n             ha='center', va='bottom')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](post1_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=829 height=523}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis visualization allows us to quickly compare the vocabulary richness of different authors, including our \"Unknown\" text. In this example, we can see that the Unknown author's vocabulary richness is closest to that of Oscar Wilde, providing a clue to potential authorship.\n\n## Advanced Techniques: Stylometric Fingerprinting\n\nWhile basic metrics like vocabulary richness are useful, more advanced techniques can provide even more accurate authorship attribution. One such technique is the use of function words - common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"of\" that are used regardless of the topic of the text.\n\nLet's create a function to analyze the usage of function words in a text:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\ndef function_word_profile(text):\n    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())\n    function_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    \n    word_freq = Counter(words)\n    function_word_freq = {word: count for word, count in word_freq.items() if word in function_words}\n    \n    total_words = sum(word_freq.values())\n    function_word_ratios = {word: count/total_words for word, count in function_word_freq.items()}\n    \n    return function_word_ratios\n\n# Example usage:\nprofile = function_word_profile(sample_text)\nprint(profile)\n```\n\nThis function creates a profile of function word usage in a text, which can serve as a more robust \"fingerprint\" of an author's style.\n\n## Putting It All Together: A Case Study\n\nLet's imagine we have a mysterious manuscript, and we suspect it might have been written by one of three authors: Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, or Oscar Wilde. We can use our stylometric tools to investigate.\n\nFirst, we'd need to gather sample texts from each author and our unknown text. Then, we'd apply our analysis functions to each text:\n\n```python\nauthors = {\n    'Austen': austen_text,\n    'Dickens': dickens_text,\n    'Wilde': wilde_text,\n    'Unknown': unknown_text\n}\n\nresults = {}\nfor author, text in authors.items():\n    results[author] = {\n        'basic_analysis': analyze_text(text),\n        'function_word_profile': function_word_profile(text)\n    }\n```\n\nNext, we'd compare the results, looking for similarities between our unknown text and the known authors. We might find that the unknown text has a vocabulary richness very similar to Wilde's, uses sentence structures more like Austen's, but has a function word profile closer to Dickens'.\n\nTo visualize these complex relationships, we could use dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to plot our texts in a two-dimensional space:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Extract feature vectors (this is a simplified example)\nfeature_vectors = [\n    [\n        results[author]['basic_analysis']['vocab_richness'],\n        results[author]['basic_analysis']['avg_sentence_length'],\n        # ... other features ...\n    ]\n    for author in authors\n]\n\n# Normalize the data\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nnormalized_vectors = scaler.fit_transform(feature_vectors)\n\n# Apply PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\npca_result = pca.fit_transform(normalized_vectors)\n\n# Plot the results\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nfor i, author in enumerate(authors):\n    plt.scatter(pca_result[i, 0], pca_result[i, 1], label=author)\n    plt.annotate(author, (pca_result[i, 0], pca_result[i, 1]))\n\nplt.title('Author Style Comparison')\nplt.xlabel('First Principal Component')\nplt.ylabel('Second Principal Component')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis visualization would show us how similar or different our unknown text is to the known authors in terms of overall style.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStylometry offers a fascinating bridge between the worlds of literature and data science. By applying programming techniques to literary analysis, we can uncover patterns and insights that might elude traditional close reading methods. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these techniques can provide strong evidence, they're not infallible. Factors like an author's style evolving over time, deliberate attempts to imitate another's style, or collaborative works can all complicate authorship attribution.\n\nAs we continue to refine these techniques and develop new ones, the field of stylometry promises to shed new light on age-old questions of authorship and perhaps even reveal new insights into the nature of literary style itself.\n\nThe next time you pick up a book, remember - hidden in the words on the page is a unique linguistic fingerprint, waiting to be decoded by the keen eye of a literary detective armed with the tools of data science.\n\n## References\n\nJuola, P.

The image should feature a large, stylized fingerprint made up of words and letters in various fonts and sizes. Within the ridges of the fingerprint, incorporate subtle patterns that resemble lines of text or code. In the background, include faded images of classic literary works and modern digital devices, symbolizing the bridge between traditional literature and modern data analysis. The color scheme should be predominantly blue and white, giving a clean, technical feel, with touches of gold to represent the valuable insights gained from this analysis.\n</prompt>\n\n</blog>\n\n",
